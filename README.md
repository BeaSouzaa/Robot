## Project Overview

https://github.com/BeaSouzaa/Robot/blob/main/robot-logo.png
In this project, we use a robot to automate the navigation of a website. The robot  framework is programmed to perform various tasks, such as:

- Navigating to specific web pages.
- Interacting with page elements (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms).
- Extracting information from the website.

The goal of this project is to showcase how robots can be used for automated testing.
